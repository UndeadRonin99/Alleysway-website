## Controllers Overview

### AccountController
- Handles user authentication through Google OAuth.
- Manages login, token verification, and redirects users based on their roles (Admin or Client).
- Interacts with Firebase to manage user data in real-time.

### AdminController
- Provides functionality for admins to manage client sessions and payments.
- Integrates with Google Calendar to manage training sessions.
- Admins can update profiles, availability, and delete accounts.
- Admin Dashboard displays data fetched from Firebase.

### ClientController
- Clients can manage their profile, book training sessions, and chat with trainers.
- Integrates Google Calendar to display training sessions.
- Similar to AdminController but tailored for clients.

## Firebase Integration

### Firebase Authentication

Firebase Admin SDK is used for authenticating users, managing tokens, and verifying users' identities. Google OAuth is used to log in via Google accounts, and users are redirected based on their role.

### Firebase Realtime Database

- **Session Management**: All client and admin session details are stored in Firebase. Admins can update session statuses and manage payments.
- **Profile Data**: Client and admin profile data, including names, profile pictures, and rates, are stored and fetched from Firebase.

### Google Calendar Integration

The **GoogleCalendarService** is responsible for creating, managing, and embedding calendar events. Clients can book sessions with trainers, and these bookings are synchronized with the trainerâ€™s Google Calendar.
